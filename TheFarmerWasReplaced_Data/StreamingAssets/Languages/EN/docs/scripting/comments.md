# Comments
Comments are parts of the code that are ignored during execution.
Comments can be added using `#`. Anything on the same line after the `#` is a comment and will be ignored.

`#this is a comment`

This can be useful to add notes to the code, and also to temporarily disable parts of the code without deleting them.

Any comment on the line before a function definition will be part of the popup information that appears when you mouse over the function name.
`#This function does nothing.
def f():
    pass`
