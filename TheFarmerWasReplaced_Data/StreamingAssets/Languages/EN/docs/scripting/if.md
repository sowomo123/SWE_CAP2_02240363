# If
You can use if, elif and else to run code conditionally.

`if condition1:
	do_a_flip()
elif condition2:
	harvest()
else:
	do_a_flip()
	harvest()`

## Syntax
`if`s allow you to run code only if some condition is `True`. They are like a `while` loop that doesn't loop.
The `if` takes a condition just like the `while` loop and executes the if code block if the condition evaluates to `True`:

`#do a flip if condition is True
if condition:
	do_a_flip()`

You can also add an `else` after the if that defines code to be executed if the condition evaluates to `False`:

`if condition:
	#do a flip if condition is True
	do_a_flip()
else:
	#otherwise harvest
	harvest()`

`elif` is short for else if.

`if condition1:
	#a
else:
	if condition2:
		#b
	else:
		#c`

can be shortened to:

`if condition1:
	#a
elif condition2:
	#b
else:
	#c`
