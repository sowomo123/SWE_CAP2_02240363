# Multi Trade
Buying items one by one takes a lot of time. You can now specify the number of items you want to trade in a second argument.

For example, if you want to buy 5 carrot seeds, you can write
`trade(Items.Carrot_Seed, 5)`
If you can't afford that many, this will simply do nothing instead of buying less.
