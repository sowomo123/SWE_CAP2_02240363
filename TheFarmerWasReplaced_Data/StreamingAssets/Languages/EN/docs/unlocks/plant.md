# Plants
Grass is nice because it grows automatically. All other plants have to be planted with the `plant()` function. The only plant you can plant right now is a bush.
You can pass the type of plant you want to plant to the function like this:

`plant(Entities.Bush)`

This will plant a bush under the drone.

Call `clear()` to reset the farm to all grass and reset the drone position.
