# Debug 2
When your drone gets too fast and the grid too big it can be hard to see what's going on anymore.

For this reason there are the `set_execution_speed()` and `set_farm_size()` functions.
They allow you to reduce the execution speed and the farm size. 

The farm size and the execution speed will be reset to the default values at the end of the execution.
