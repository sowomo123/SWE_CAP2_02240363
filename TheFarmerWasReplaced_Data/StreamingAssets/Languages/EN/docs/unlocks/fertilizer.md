# Fertilizer
At some point, waiting for the plants to grow is just not efficient enough anymore. 
Fertilizer can make plants grow instantly. `use_item(Items.Fertilizer)` reduces the remaining growing time of the plant under the drone by 2 seconds.
Fertilizer can be bought with `trade(Items.Fertilizer)`.

Using fertilizer dries up the ground. The water speed buff will still apply while the fertilizer is being used, but after that, the water level on the ground will be reduced to `0`.
