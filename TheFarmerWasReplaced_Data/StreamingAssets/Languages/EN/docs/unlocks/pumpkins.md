# Pumpkins
Pumpkins grow like carrots on tilled soil. They require pumpkin seeds to be planted, which cost one carrot each.

When all the pumpkins in a field are fully grown, they grow together to form a giant pumpkin. The yield of a giant pumpkin is the cubed side length of the pumpkin.

A 2x2 pumpkin yields `2*2*2 = 8` pumpkins instead of `4`
A 3x3 pumpkin yields `3*3*3 = 27` pumpkins instead of `9`
A 4x4 pumpkin yields `4*4*4 = 64` pumpkins instead of `16`
...

It's a good idea to get the pumpkins as big as possible before harvesting. The problem is that about 1 in 5 pumpkins will die before they grow up. This means that even if you plant a pumpkin on every tile in a square, one of the pumpkins may die and prevent the mega pumpkin from growing. A pumpkin that dies will simply disappear so you can plant a new one.
