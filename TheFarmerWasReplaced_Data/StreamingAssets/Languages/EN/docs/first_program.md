# First Program
## Text editor
All programming is done in code windows. Each code window corresponds to a text file containing code. 
You can rename the file by clicking the name of the window.

The code can be edited like in any text editor as long as it's not running.
You can execute the program directly by pressing the green play button in the code window.

You can create more code files using the "+" button in the upper right corner of the screen.
You can dock a window to another window by dragging it onto it.

You will notice that once you start typing, a simple code completion window will pop up.
Press Tab to insert the code completion.
Use the arrow keys to navigate through the completion options.

Don't worry if this is your first time programming. The language is unlocked step by step, so you won't be overwhelmed by all the things you can do. 
The syntax is also similar to that of Python, which is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, so learning it is not completely wasted.

If you already know Python, it's not a problem either, you'll just be able to skip the early game quickly to get to the more interesting stuff.

Code is a sequence of statements that are executed line by line.

Currently, the only statements available are

`harvest()`

and 

`do_a_flip()`

These are function calls. A function is essentially a piece of functionality that can be executed. You execute it using the `()` parentheses.

Try typing these statements in the code window and pressing the execute button.

## Unlocks
Collecting grass will give you hay. Hay can be used to unlock loops in the unlock menu. Open the unlock menu with the button in the top right corner.
