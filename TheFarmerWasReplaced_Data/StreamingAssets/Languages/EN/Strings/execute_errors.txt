@error_wrong_number_args = {0} takes {1} arguments.
@error_expected_no_args = {0} doesn't take any arguments.
@error_wrong_args = The {0}. argument of {1} was {2}. This is not a valid argument.
@error_syntax_error_in_function = The file this function is defined in has a syntax error.
@error_append_on_non_list = `append()` can only be used on lists. It can't be used on {0}.
@error_add_on_non_set = `add()` can only be used on sets. It can't be used on {0}.
@error_remove_on_non_list_or_set = `remove()` can only be used on lists and sets. It can't be used on {0}.
@error_pop_on_non_dict_or_list = `pop()` can only be used on lists and dictionaries. It can't be used on {0}.
@error_insert_on_non_list = `insert()` can only be used on lists. It can't be used on {0}.
@error_list_element_not_found = {0} is not an element in the list.
@error_set_element_not_found = {0} is not an element of the set.
@error_index_out_of_bounds = The index {0} you tried to access was outside the list {1}.
@error_index_out_of_bounds2 = The index you tried to access was outside the list.
@error_arith_assign_not_used_on_number = {0} can only be used on numbers.
@error_bool_op_not_used_on_bool = A logic operator can only be used on boolean expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False`.
@error_bad_bin_operator = The operator {0} cannot be used on the operands {1} and {2}.
@error_bad_unary_operator = The operator {0} cannot be used on {1}.
@error_index = {0} cannot be used as an index on {1}.
@error_index_on_non_indexable = You cannot index into {0}.
@error_zero_step = The step size cannot be zero.
@error_index_on_tuple = You can't assign a tuple element because tuples are immutable.
@error_bad_key = {0} cannot be used as a key.
@error_slice_dict = Can't slice dictionaries.
@error_key = {0} is not a key in the dictionary.
@error_condition_not_bool = {0} is not a valid condition. The condition must be a boolean value. This means it must be an expression that is always either `True` or `False`.
@error_for_requires_iterable = {0} can't be iterated in a for loop. The for loop must be given a sequence to iterate over. Example:

`for i in range(5):`
Here range(5) returns the sequence `0,1,2,3,4`.
@error_no_loop_to_break = `break` can only be used inside of a loop.
@error_no_loop_to_continue = `continue` can only be used inside of a loop.
@error_no_function_to_return_from = `return` can only be used inside a function.
@error_missing_unlock = This must be unlocked before it can be used.
@error_missing_x_unlock = {0} must be unlocked before this can be used.
@error_missing_trade_unlock = Specifying a number to be traded requires multi trade to be unlocked first.
@error_cant_trade_negative = The number of items to trade cannot be negative.
@error_item_cant_be_traded = {0} cannot be bought.
@error_name_not_defined = {0} has never been defined. You must assign a value to a variable before using it.
@error_invalid_const = {0} doesn't exist.
@error_invalid_const2 = This doesn't exist.
@error_max_stack_size_reached = The maximum call stack size has been reached. This is most likely due to too many recursive function calls.
@error_max_comparison_depth = The maximum comparison depth has been reached.
@error_assign_type_mismatch = The left hand side of the assignment didn't match the right hand side.
@error_too_many_values_to_unpack = The right hand side doesn't contain enough values to unpack.
@error_not_enough_values = The right side contains too many values to be unpacked into the left side.
@error_empty_print = Can't print nothing.
@error_in_string = Cannot check if {0} is in a string.
@error_collection_changed_size_during_iteration = Attempted to change the size of the collection during iteration.
@error_wrong_use_of_max = Can't compute the max of {0}.
@error_wrong_use_of_min = Can't compute the min of {0}.
@error_function_as_condition = Trying to check if the function {0} is `True`. This is the function object itself, not the function's return value. Did you mean to call the function with the call operator `()`? 

In Python, functions objects are truthy, which means that if you use them as conditions, they work like `True`, so Python wouldn't give you this error message. 

This is a safeguard error message, you can turn it off in the options if it gets in your way.
@error_function_in_operator = Trying to use {1} on the function {0}. This is the function object itself, not the function's return value. Did you mean to call the function with the call operator `()`? 
@error_shadow = Trying to create a local variable with the name {0}. {0} already exists in an outer scope. Having two variables with the same name is usually a bad idea. 

Read about scopes for more information.

This is a safeguard error message, you can turn it off in the options if it gets in your way.
@error_zero_step_size = The step size cannot be 0.
@error_sequence_too_large = The sequence was too large to copy.
