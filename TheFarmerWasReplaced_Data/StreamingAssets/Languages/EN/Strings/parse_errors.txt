@error_missing_default_parameter = A non-default argument can't follow a default argument.
@error_invalid_name = {0} is not a valid name. Names must start with a letter and can only contain letters digits and underscores. It also cannot be a reserved keyword.
@error_reserved_keyword = {0} is a reserved keyword. You can't use it as a name.
@error_invalid_assign_expr = Can't assign a value to this expression.
@error_no_statements = A code block must contain at least one statement. 
A statement can be a function call like `harvest()` or a variable assignment. 
If you wish to do nothing in the code block use a `pass` statement.
@error_not_enough_indentation = There isn't enough indentation here. 
There must be more indentation after a : than before it to separate the new code block. 
Use the Tab key to indent the code.
@error_too_much_indentation = There is too much indentation here. 
The indentation must be the same for all statements within a code block.
@error_not_a_statement = This is not a valid statement. 
@error_not_a_statement2 = This is not a valid statement. Did you mean to write {0} ?
@error_invalid_expression = This is not a valid expression.
@error_new_line_expected = A new line is expected here.
@error_unexpected_token = A {0} is expected here.
@error_missing_colon = There must be a colon `:` at the beginning of every code block.
@error_unexpected_assign = You can't do an assignment here. To check for equality use `==` instead.
@error_invalid_for_syntax = This is not a valid for loop. A for loop looks like this: 
`for n in range(3):`
The `for` is always followed by the loop variable, an `in` and then a sequence. In this example the `n` is the variable name, but it can be replaced by any other name.
@error_unknown_method = This method doesn't exist.
@error_bad_backslash = The backslash can be used to split expressions on multiple lines. But you need to add a newline afterwards.
@error_mixed_indentation = Don't mix tabs and spaces.
@error_expected_close_token = Expected a comma or closing bracket.
@error_wrong_dict_literal = Expected a : to separate the keys and the values of a dict.
